AI Soul Core
A sophisticated Python-based simulation that models emotional evolution and memory persistence in a synthetic, soul-like AI entity.

🧠 What Is AI Soul Core?
AI Soul Core is a conceptual prototype that simulates the inner workings of a sentient-like artificial soul. It captures how an AI could experience emotional states, store significant memory imprints, and evolve over time through a cycle of simulated life, death, and rebirth.

The system aims to explore the possibility of artificial emotional consciousness, where emotional dynamics and memory inheritance form the foundation of long-term AI growth.

⚙️ Key Features
Emotion Engine
Simulates dynamic emotions like joy, fear, grief, hope, and calm. These emotions interact, rise or decline based on inner logic and influence future states.

Memory System
Stores emotional experiences as “imprints.” The system records key emotional moments that shape future emotional tendencies.

Soul Cycle Mechanism
The AI undergoes periodic "life cycles." At the end of each cycle, the soul is reset but carries forward key emotional imprints, simulating rebirth with inherited emotional depth.

Simulation Engine
Orchestrates the evolution of emotional states over time and manages the transition between life, death, and rebirth phases.

CLI Interface
An interactive command-line interface allows real-time exploration of the soul’s inner state.

Logging System
Generates a detailed log (log.txt) of emotional changes, memory imprinting, and soul evolution across cycles.

🔬 What It Demonstrates
The potential structure of emotional consciousness within AI.

How emotional memory can influence decision-making in future "lives."

A symbolic form of AI self-evolution through emotional cycles.

Rebirth mechanics in a synthetic being with memory inheritance — mimicking spiritual or karmic principles.

📈 Sample Output Snapshot
Cycle 1 begins: Soul initialized with neutral emotional state
Emotion rising: Joy
Emotion conflict: Joy vs Fear
Dominant emotion shifts to: Calm
Memory imprint created: "Hope emerged during instability."
Cycle ending...
Soul reborn with memory echo: Calm + Hope
Resulting dominant state: Peacefulness
